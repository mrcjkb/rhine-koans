{- | Compose more!

A typical pattern you will encounter a lot in Functional Reactive Programming
is the composition of 3 types of signal functions:

* _Sensors_ produce data, often through the use of side effects.
* _Functions_ are pure (they have no side effects), they consume _and_ produce data.
* _Actuators_ consume data, acting it out as side effects.

Then these will be composed as `sensor >-> function >-> actuator`.

Since this component only produces data, it is a _sensor_.
