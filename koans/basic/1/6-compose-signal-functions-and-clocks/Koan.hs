{- | Compose signal functions with clocks.

So far, we always had one clock, and added it to our program right at the end with the @@ operator.
But what actually happens when we apply @@?

* On its left side, it expects a clocked signal function.
* The right side must be a clock value.
* The clock types of both sides have to match.
* The output of @@ is a type we haven't seen explicitly yet: it's called 'Rhine'!

We end up with a complete program that consists of a signal function which produces, processes, and consumes data,
and a clock which drives the signal function at a specific rate.

But unfortunately, some very strange error messages have crept in.
This is because we have used the general composition operator >>> instead of the Rhine-specific operator >->,
and the type checker is confused which of @@ and >>> to apply first.
Can you fix it?
