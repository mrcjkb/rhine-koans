{- | Faster!

Maybe you've already noticed: In Rhine, clock rates are specified _on the type level_.
This means, that we can write clock types in a type signature, or also in a type synonym.
Often, the code becomes more readable if we use type synonyms.

Now, can you output the message "Hello Rhine!" _ten times_ per second?
