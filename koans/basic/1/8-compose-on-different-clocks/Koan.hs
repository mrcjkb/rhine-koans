{- | Compose on different clocks.

Clocked signal functions on the same clock type can be composed,
and they can be run with a value of that clock type.
But often we want to run different components at different rates!

To compose parts with different clocks,
Rhine has the concept of a 'ResamplingBuffer'.
This is a basic component that consumes and produces data on two different clocks.

Two 'Rhine's can be composed with a resampling buffer if all clock types and data types match.
