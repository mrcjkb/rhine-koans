There are a number of ways how you can create internal state yourself.
One of them is 'feedback'. Let's look at its type signature:

@
feedback :: s -> ClSF m (a, s) (b, s) -> ClSF m a b
@

'feedback' takes an internal state @s@,
and a signal function with two inputs and two outputs.
The two inputs are @a@ and the current internal state @s@.
The two outputs are @b@ and the modified internal state.
'feedback' then hides this state, which is why at the end,
the return type is @ClSF m a b@.

If you call 'feedback', you can pass an arbitrary signal function as second argument.
It allows you to use and modify the internal state.
